# Configuration of the binfmt_misc handler of ExaGear.

#
# Normally binfmt_misc handler does not allow starting SUID programs because
# it requires giving extra privileges to ExaGear. If you find it necessary
# to run SUID or SGID binaries under ExaGear, say Y here.
#
# Note: vulnerabilities in x86 SUID binaries can be used to corrupt memory
# of the translator; it potentially increases the surface of attack.
# It is therefore recommended that you disable the support for SUID binaries
# after the installation of guest software packages.
#
# After modifying the settings here, run
#     service exagear restart
# to apply the changes.
